					Milling rice is a state of art and it needs combination of experience, technology and quality of raw material; which plays major role in determining the final product quality. We at new haryana overseas have focussed and specialized only on steam, raw, aged steam and aged raw basmati rice. Steam and raw grains are very delicate grains as compared to sella or parboil in consideration of milling, it needs specialization in every stage of procurement, handeling, cleaning, pre drying, storage, processing, drying, dehusking and milling of basmati paddy. The process starts from procurement of raw material. For manufacturing of steam and raw rice very healthy paddy is required. We are situated in foothils of himalya where paddy of pure quality is cultivated in the fertile land of punjab & haryana watered with snow fed water from himalayas. Geographical position of our rice mills supports us in procurring the best raw material for process. Very strict monitoring of raw material is done physically and scienctifically by our expert staff. The technology contributed a crucial part in the milling process; because of the old factoryâ€™s structure and to produce high quality rice we have installed high technology machines from satake japan and buhler germany with self developed plc programs to get best out of them. All the physical parameteres like raw matereial moisture, final product moisture, average grain length, whiteness, milling degree and results of cooking like elongation, volumetric expansion and water absorption ratio are measured scienctifically during production and packing of finished goods.
